      This typically means you have ran into one of the following scenarios:
      - You've checked out a shallow copy of the Git repository, which {bold actions/checkout@v2} does by default.
        In order for Chromatic to correctly determine baseline commits, we need access to the full Git history graph.
        With {bold actions/checkout@v2}, you can enable this by setting 'fetch-depth: 0'.

      - You've only made a single commit so far. 
        Please make at least one additional commit in order for Chromatic to be able to detect what's changed.
