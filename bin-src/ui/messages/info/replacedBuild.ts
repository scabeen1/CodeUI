    When detecting git changes for TurboSnap, we couldn't find the commit (${commit(
      replacedBuild
    )}) for the most recent build (#${replacedBuild.number}).
    To avoid re-snapshotting stories we know haven't changed, we copied from the most recent build (#${
      replacementBuild.number
    }) that did have a commit (${commit(replacementBuild)}) instead.
  `);
